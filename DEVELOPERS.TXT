* RDoc, for generating HTML Ruby API documentation
* Doxygen, for generating HTML C++ API documentation
* dot (part of Graphviz), for generating diagrams in HTML API documentation
* The font "Bitstream Vera Sans", used in the class diagrams. See http://www.gnome.org/fonts
* AsciiDoc >= 8.2.5, for converting various doc/*.txt documents to HTML

Run the following command to compile everything:

 rake

== Directory structure

The most important directories are:
[ lib/passenger ]
  The source code for the spawn server, which is written in Ruby.
[ ext/passenger ]
  Native extensions for Ruby, used by the spawn server.
[ ext/apache2 ]
  The Phusion Passenger Apache 2 module (mod_passenger).
[ bin ]
  Executables.
[ doc ]
  Various documentation.
[ test ]
  Unit tests and integration tests.
[ test/support ]

Less important directories:
[ lib/rake ]
  Rake tasks.
[ ext/boost ]
  A vendor copy of the Boost C++ library (www.boost.org).
[ benchmark ]
  Benchmark tools.
[ misc ]
  Miscellaneous tools.

== Tests

Run all tests:

 rake

Run just the tests for the Apache 2 module:

 rake test:apache2

Run just the unit tests for the Ruby spawn server:

 rake test:ruby

Run just the integration tests:

 rake test:integration

*Note*: some tests, such as the ones that test privilege lowering, require
root privileges. Those will only be run if Rake is run as root.

== Documentation

Various developer documents can be found in 'doc/*.html'.

The Ruby part's API reference is located in 'doc/rdoc/'.
The C++ part's API reference is located in 'doc/cxxapi/'.
